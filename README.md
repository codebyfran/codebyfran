# I’m :fr:  

:man_dancing: Some say *“I code with the elegance of a Renaissance poet—logic in structure, poetry in syntax.”*  
Me? I just like experimenting, pushing boundaries, and seeing what happens when you rebuild something from the ground up.  

✨ **Quality Over Quantity**  
I’d rather ship one thing that makes an impact than ten half-baked projects. Code isn’t about volume — it’s about clarity, performance, and leaving something behind that others can rely on.  

🤝 **Team Player**  
Collaboration fuels my work. From brainstorming wild ideas to debugging at crunch time — great projects come from great teams.  

🚀 **Always Exploring**  
Tech never stands still, and neither do I. Whether it’s new frameworks, AI-driven workflows, or experimental hacks, I’m always curious and always moving forward.  

📚 **Always Learning**  
Treating every project as a chance to learn 

🛠 **Always Breaking**  
I don’t just build — I break, rebuild, and reshape. Sometimes it’s clean, sometimes it’s a Frankenstein of ideas stitched together. But it’s never static. Experiment, fail fast, and keep moving forward — that’s the game.
